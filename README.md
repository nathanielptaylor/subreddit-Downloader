# subreddit-Downloader
Can download images from a subreddit given keywords

Built for python 2 because I am too lazy to use urllib3
You need to insall Praw for it to work, use the command:
pip install "praw<6.4"

Then use 
python subredditDwnldr.py
to run the program
There are several options
1. Choose what subreddit to search
2. choose keywords to search for
3. how many pictures to download
4. Where to save them
5. what each file should be named. (The actual file name will be whatever you enter here + a random number between 1 and 999)

This is built on Debian 10, but shouldn't require too much to work on any other os.

Use your own reddit id, or just use mine. I don't really care.
